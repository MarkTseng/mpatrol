Changes for 1.1.0

  * Added a new file containing answers to frequently asked questions.

  * Added references to the memory management reference, FreshMeat and eGroups
    in the mpatrol manual.  Also added more related software and removed the
    authors from the concept index.

  * Changed the suffix of the ASCII documentation from .doc to .txt since it
    was being wrongly assumed to be a Microsoft Word document.

  * Object libraries are now no longer built when the all Makefile target is
    used.

  * The library now replaces the memset(), bzero(), memcpy(), memmove() and
    bcopy() functions for tracing and debugging purposes.

  * Added the expand() function for backwards compatibility with other C
    libraries.

  * Added the LOGMEMORY option to log all calls to memory operation functions.

  * Added the SAFESIGNALS option which is now no longer enabled by default.

  * Added a summary of bytes copied and set when __mp_summary() is called.

  * Dynamic symbols are now used on GNU BFD as well as ELF when the object file
    has been stripped of its symbol table.

  * Relevant options and flags have been added for mallopt() support.

  * Added new tests for the memory operation functions.


Changes for 1.0.8 (20th December, 1999)

  * Added the utilities and library functions sections and documented the pkg
    directory and how to use other libraries with mpatrol in the mpatrol manual.

  * Made reading the ELF dynamic linker independent of file format since Linux
    now uses the GNU BFD library rather than the ELF access library.


Changes for 1.0.7 (29th November, 1999)

  * Added the overwrites and underwrites, testing, library behaviour and general
    errors sections and the how it works chapter to the mpatrol manual.

  * Added support for building PKG and RPM packages.


Changes for 1.0.6 (25th November, 1999)

  * Removed the NOTES, INSTALL and EXAMPLES files as their contents are now
    entirely in the mpatrol manual.

  * Added the operating system support, using mpatrol, improving performance and
    library performance chapters to the mpatrol manual.

  * Added lots of software for AmigaOS to the related software section in the
    mpatrol manual.

  * Added new library performance figures.

  * Added the FAILFREQ and FAILSEED options.

  * The __mp_trap() function now does nothing so that it can be used as a
    breakpoint target in a debugger.

  * Increased the maximum size of the MPATROL_OPTIONS environment variable from
    256 to 1024 bytes.


Changes for 1.0.5 (16th November, 1999)

  * Added TeXinfo documentation which can be translated to on-line manuals in
    ASCII, GNU Info, AmigaGuide and HTML format, and printed manuals in DVI,
    Postscript and PDF format.

  * Added support for allocating memory from a static array rather than the
    system heap, which might be useful on embedded systems which have no heap.


Changes for 1.0.4 (21st October, 1999)

  * Added the CHECK option.


Changes for 1.0.3 (19th October, 1999)

  * Improved library performance.

  * Added library performance figures.

  * Added total number of warnings and errors to summary.


Changes for 1.0.2 (15th October, 1999)

  * Added the USEMMAP option for UNIX platforms so that mmap() can be used
    instead of sbrk() to allocate heap memory on systems that support it.


Changes for 1.0.1 (13th October, 1999)

  * A bug that appeared when the mpatrol library was statically linked on a UNIX
    system that defaults to dynamic linking has been fixed.

  * A potential problem with losing details of some free memory blocks when the
    library runs out of system memory has been fixed.

  * Added a new examples document which illustrates the features of the mpatrol
    library with annotated examples.


Changes for 1.0.0 (11th October, 1999)

  * First public release.
