Title:          mpatrol
Version:        1.2.5
Entered-date:   2000-07-12
Description:    A link library that attempts to diagnose run-time errors that
                are caused by the wrong use of dynamically allocated memory.
                Along with providing a comprehensive and configurable log of
                all dynamic memory operations that occurred during the
                lifetime of a program, the mpatrol library performs extensive
                checking to detect any misuse of dynamically allocated memory.
                All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code
                through the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time.
                All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is
                sent to a separate log file in order to keep its diagnostics
                separate from any that the program being tested might
                generate.  A wide variety of library settings can also be
                changed at run-time via an environment variable, thus removing
                the need to recompile or relink in order to change the
                library's behaviour.
