       The mmpprrooff command is a tool designed to read  a  profiling
       output  file  produced  by the mpatrol library and display
       the profiling information that was obtained.  The  profil-
       ing  information  includes  summaries of all of the memory
       allocations listed by size and the function that allocated
       them and a list of memory leaks with the call stack of the
       allocating function.

       When the PPRROOFF option is used  with  the  mpatrol  library,
       statistics  for all dynamic memory allocations and deallo-
       cations are written to a profiling output file.  The  name
       of  this  file can be changed with the PPRROOFFFFIILLEE option and
       the frequency at which the file is written can  be  speci-
       fied with the AAUUTTOOSSAAVVEE option.  The bounds for small allo-
       cations, medium allocations, large allocations  and  extra
       large  allocations can be set with the SSMMAALLLLBBOOUUNNDD, MMEEDDIIUUMM--
       BBOOUUNNDD and LLAARRGGEEBBOOUUNNDD options.

       Only allocations and deallocations are recorded, with each
       reallocation  being  treated as a deallocation immediately
       followed by an allocation.   For  full  memory  allocation
       profiling  support, call stack traversal must be supported
       in the mpatrol library and all of  the  program's  symbols
       must  have  been  successfully read by the mpatrol library
       before the  program  was  run.   The  mmpprrooff  command  will
       attempt  to compensate if either of these requirements are
       not met, but the displayed tables may contain  less  mean-
       ingful information.

       The _f_i_l_e argument must be a valid mpatrol profiling output
       filename but if _f_i_l_e is omitted then mmpprrooff will  use  _m_p_a_-
       _t_r_o_l_._o_u_t  as the name of the profiling output file to use.
       If _f_i_l_e is given as _- then the standard input file  stream
       will be used as the profiling output file.

       Much of the functionality of this tool is based upon mmpprrooff
       by Benjamin Zorn and Paul Hilfinger, which was written  as
       a  research  project  and  ran  on  MIPS,  SPARC  and  VAX
       machines.  However, the profiling output files are  incom-
       patible, the tables displayed have a different format, and
       the way they are implemented is entirely different.

       --aa     Specifies that different call sites from within the
              same function are to be differentiated and that the
              names of all functions  should  be  displayed  with

              their  call site offset in bytes.  This affects the
              direct allocation and memory leak tables.

       --cc     Specifies that certain tables should be  sorted  by
              the  number  of allocations or deallocations rather
              than the total number of bytes allocated or deallo-
              cated.  This affects the direct allocation and mem-
              ory leak tables.

       --nn _d_e_p_t_h
              Specifies the maximum stack depth to use when  cal-
              culating  if  one call site has the same call stack
              as another call site.  This also specifies the max-
              imum  number  of  functions  to  display  in a call
              stack.  If _d_e_p_t_h is _0 then  the  call  stack  depth
              will  be unlimited in size.  The default call stack
              depth is _1.  This affects the memory leak table.

       --VV     Displays the version number of the mmpprrooff command.
