       mptrace  -  displays  tracing  information produced by the

       The mmppttrraaccee command is a tool designed to read  a  tracing
       output  file  produced  by the mpatrol library and display
       the tracing information that was  obtained.   The  tracing
       information  is a concise encoded trace of all of the mem-
       ory allocation events that  occurred  during  a  program's
       execution,  and  can  be decoded into tabular or graphical
       form, along with any relevant statistics that can be  cal-
       culated.

       When  the  TTRRAACCEE  option is used with the mpatrol library,
       statistics for all dynamic memory allocations and  deallo-
       cations are written to a tracing output file.  The name of
       this file can be changed with the TTRRAACCEEFFIILLEE option.

       Only allocations and deallocations are recorded, with each
       reallocation  being  treated as a deallocation immediately
       followed by an allocation.  The intention of tracing is to
       gather  concise details about each memory allocation event
       rather than complete information about some or all  memory
       allocations.   As a result, the mpatrol log files and pro-
       filing output  files  contain  more  detailed  information
       about  individual  memory allocations, whereas the tracing
       output  files  contain  a  broader  view   of   allocation
       behaviour throughout the entire program.

       The  _f_i_l_e  argument must be a valid mpatrol tracing output
       filename but if _f_i_l_e is omitted then mmppttrraaccee will use _m_p_a_-
       _t_r_o_l_._t_r_a_c_e  as the name of the tracing output file to use.
       If _f_i_l_e is given as _- then the standard input file  stream
       will be used as the tracing output file.

       The  idea  for  graphically displaying a memory map of the
       heap comes from the xxmmeemm tool supplied with the University
       of  Toronto  Computer  Systems  Research  Institute malloc
       library, written by Mark Moraes.  However, the  documenta-
       tion  for that tool remarks that it was written as a quick
       and dirty hack.  The mmppttrraaccee  command  is  hopefully  more
       stable and contains a lot more functionality.
