       The  mmlleeaakk  command  is used to display all unfreed memory
       allocations from  a  log  file  produced  by  the  mpatrol
       library.  This should be used if the mpatrol library could
       not finish writing the log file due  to  abnormal  program
       termination  (which  would  prevent the SSHHOOWWUUNNFFRREEEEDD option
       from working), but note that some of the  unfreed  alloca-
       tions  might have been freed if the program had terminated
       successfully.

       The mmlleeaakk command scans through an mpatrol log file  look-
       ing  for lines beginning with _A_L_L_O_C_: and _F_R_E_E_: but ignores
       lines beginning with _R_E_A_L_L_O_C_:, so only the  LLOOGGAALLLLOOCCSS  and
       LLOOGGFFRREEEESS  options  are  necessary  when  running a program
       linked with the mpatrol library.  Note that as a result of
       this, no attempt is made to account for resizing of memory
       allocations and so the total amount of memory used by  the
       resulting  unfreed  allocations  may not be entirely accu-
       rate.

       The _f_i_l_e argument must be a valid mpatrol log filename but
       if  _f_i_l_e is omitted then mmlleeaakk will use _m_p_a_t_r_o_l_._l_o_g as the
       name of the log file to use.  The mmlleeaakk command makes  two
       passes  over  the  log  file so the file must be randomly-
       accessable.  If _f_i_l_e is given as _- then the standard input
       file stream will be used as the log file.
