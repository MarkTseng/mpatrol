.TH MPSYM 1 "14 November 2000" "Release 1.3" "mpatrol library"
.SH NAME
mpsym \- locates missing symbolic information in an mpatrol log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmpsym\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIprogfile\fP [\fIlogfile\fP]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmpsym\fP command is used to parse a log file produced by the mpatrol
library and uses a debugger to append symbol names and source level information
to code addresses in stack tracebacks.  This should be used if the
\fBUSEDEBUG\fP option is not supported on a particular platform or does not work
properly with a specific program.  It will replace all existing symbols and
source level information associated with the stack tracebacks in the mpatrol log
file and will display the resulting log file on the standard output file stream.
.PP
The \fIprogfile\fP argument must be the filename of the executable file that
produced the mpatrol log file but if \fIprogfile\fP is omitted then \fBmpsym\fP
will use \fIa.out\fP as the name of the executable file to use.  The \fBmpsym\fP
command will read the symbol table and debugging sections from this file in
order to map the code addresses that appear in the mpatrol log file into symbol
names and source level information.  If the executable file does not contain a
symbol table then no symbol names will be available and if it does not contain
the appropriate debugging sections then no source level information will be
available either.  Obviously, if the executable file is not the same as the one
that created the mpatrol log file then the final output will be wrong.
.PP
The \fIlogfile\fP argument must be a valid mpatrol log filename but if
\fIlogfile\fP is omitted then \fBmpsym\fP will use \fImpatrol.log\fP as the
name of the log file to use.  The \fBmpsym\fP command makes two passes over the
log file so the file must be randomly-accessable.
.PP
The \fBmpsym\fP command currently uses \fBgdb\fP as the debugger with which to
obtain the additional information about the code addresses in the mpatrol log
file.  It also makes use of several UNIX text processing commands in order to
extract information from the debugger's output and from the log file.  As a
result, the \fBmpsym\fP command is only likely to work on UNIX platforms or on
systems which have the necessary commands installed.  By default, it is set up
to work on 32-bit platforms, but this can be changed by altering the
\fIPOINTER\fP definition in the \fBmpsym\fP file itself.
