README FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION


This directory may contain preformatted documentation for the mpatrol library.
The documents will have been generated from the TeXinfo source using a variety
of tools and are provided partly for convenience and partly for people who do
not have suitable formatting tools installed on their system.  In all cases
these documents can be regenerated from the TeXinfo source, although there may
be slight changes in some files due to differences in the systems that they were
generated on.  Note that the UNIX manual pages are not considered part of this
documentation (although they are kept up to date) and are located in a separate
directory.


The following files are provided with the main distribution and contain all of
the information necessary to generate each of the preformatted files.
