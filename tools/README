README FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY TOOLS


This directory contains the source code for tools that are built on top of the
mpatrol library.  The functions that are defined in these files are intended to
be useful for specific applications as well as providing real-world examples of
how to extend mpatrol.  If you wish to use one of the source files in this
directory then you should first compile it and then link it into your program
along with the mpatrol library.

Alternatively, if you're likely to want to use some or all of this code at some
point in the future then you could firstly copy all of the header files into an
mpatrol subdirectory that should be installed in the same directory as the
mpatrol.h header file.  You could then build an mptools library from the source
files in this directory and install it in the same directory that you have the
mpatrol library installed in.

If you've written a useful extension to mpatrol then you might wish to submit
it for inclusion in the next release of mpatrol.  Even if it's just for a
specific application, there might be other users out there that may benefit
from it.  You'll even get a credit in the manual!  Note that any documentation
should be written in the associated header file.
