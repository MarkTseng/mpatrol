NOTES FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY


Library performance

    The following times were obtained on a Sun Ultra 5 with an UltraSPARC IIi
    processor running at 333MHz and running Solaris 7.  The test performed was
    the one in tests/pass/test1.c and all tests were run on a lightly loaded
    system, but were run several times to obtain an average result.  Obviously,
    these times can only be an approximation, but should serve to illustrate the
    effects on performance that each option can have.  All times are given in
    seconds, and the second time on each line was obtained with the same
    options plus the NOPROTECT option.  Running with the CHECK=0 option would
    speed things up dramatically, albeit at the expense of less error checking.
