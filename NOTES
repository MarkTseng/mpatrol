NOTES FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY


This document contains information about known bugs and limitations in the
mpatrol library as well as listing potential future enhancements.  Guidelines
on how to add support for new operating systems, processor architectures and
object file formats to the library source code appear at the bottom of this
file.

Bugs should be reported to <mpatrol@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> along with the
details of the operating system, processor architecture and object file format
that the mpatrol library is being used with - and don't forget to include the
version of the mpatrol library you are using!  Keep in mind that I only have
access to an Amiga running RedHat Linux/m68k 5.1 and AmigaOS 3.1, so I will be
most likely unable to reproduce most of the system-specific bugs.  A bug report
that comes with an associated fix will be most welcome.

Enhancement requests and source code containing enhancements should also be sent
to <mpatrol@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk>.  If you are planning to implement an
enhancement, let me know first in case I am (or someone else is) working towards
the same goal - that way, work won't be wasted.  If you wish to send me source
code changes please send the changes as context diffs or in an e-mail attachment
as a compressed tar archive.


Notes for all platforms

  * C++ support is very limited, and will only really work for old C++ code
    due to the way the operators are overridden (i.e. there are no
    exceptions versions of the functions and they are not defined in a
    namespace).  There are also likely to be problems with the macros which
    redefine malloc(), etc., since there may be member functions in code that
    will mistakenly be redefined if their names match the macro definitions.
    Note also that I haven't yet figured out a way to pass down the function,
    filename and line number from a call to operator new, for example.  Perhaps
    there isn't one and it would have to be done from within the compiler.

  * The thread-safe code in the library doesn't yet work properly, probably
    because of the recursion flag which is incremented or decremented before
    the mutex is locked.  Hence, the threads test (tests/pass/test5.c) doesn't
    work yet.

  * Need to make the library re-entrant.  This could be achieved by moving the
    static variables in memory.c, mutex.c, diag.c and option.c into the infohead
    structure and then having an array of infohead structures from which to
    allocate new memory headers when a new one is required.  This is only
    necessary for Amiga shared libraries and Netware NLMs since UNIX and Windows
    platforms allocate a new copy of the data section in a shared library or DLL
    when it is opened by a new process.

  * The current implementation of call stack traversal is limited and will only
    likely work for unoptimised code.  A much better solution would be write the
    implementation at a lower level in assembly, but this is much less portable.
    Perhaps there is a library which can be used to perform this across many
    operating systems and processor architectures, or maybe someone would like
    to write one?  I can think of many applications that would benefit from such
    a library besides this one.

  * An alternative implementation for call stack traversal uses the functions
    __builtin_frame_address() and __builtin_return_address() that are available
    when the library is compiled with GCC.  However, they can only traverse a
    number of stack frames at compile-time, not run-time so there is a maximum
    number of stack frames that can be traversed at any one time.  The
    implementation depends on both of these builtin functions returning NULL
    when the top of stack is reached.  If this is not the case then this method
    cannot be used.

  * In object file formats that support nested symbols (such as ELF), the
    current implementation will tend to show some shortcomings.  This is because
    there is currently no nesting count in the function that deals with symbol
    name lookup, so the wrong symbol name may be displayed in diagnostics.

  * In object file formats that don't store the sizes of symbols (such as basic
    COFF, or when using the GNU BFD library), the current implementation will
    simply assume that the current symbol terminates at the beginning of the
    next symbol in the virtual address space.

  * Perhaps debugging information could be utilised when the library is reading
    the symbol table from an executable file.  This could be used to add line
    number information to the call stack, but could also be used to extend the
    library to monitor static and stack variables.

  * Script files similar to the mpatrol shell script provided for UNIX platforms
    could be added for the other operating systems that the mpatrol library is
    available on.  Perhaps this could even be extended to a common executable
    command that is written in C.


Notes for UNIX platforms

  * Need to add watch point area support for non-Solaris operating systems.
    This may be a case of preventing all heap memory from being accessed and
    providing a signal handler that is called when a read from or write to such
    memory triggers a signal.  The handler could then determine if the address
    is in a watch point, and if it is not it could unprotect the memory and
    return.

  * Need to add advanced signal information for operating systems that do not
    support the siginfo() system call.  This information is used by the signal
    handler that handles the SIGSEGV signal in order to provide useful
    information about where an illegal memory access occurred.  However, there
    is currently a problem in that the call stack displayed from within that
    handler is not necessarily accurate with respect to the function at the top
    of the stack.  Also, signal handlers shouldn't technically call I/O
    functions in case of additional signals being caught so this may need to be
    improved.

  * Need to add a portable way of initialising the thread-safe version of the
    library when it is compiled by a C compiler.  There is already a solution to
    this problem when it is compiled by a C++ compiler.

  * Need to add support for call stack traversal for at least the MIPS, PA/RISC
    and PowerPC processor architectures.  The current implementation of call
    stack traversal for the Motorola 88xx0 family is also a bit flaky and so
    should only be used when the library and program are built unoptimised.

  * Need to add support for obtaining the program name from the stack for at
    least the Motorola 88xx0, MIPS, PA/RISC and PowerPC processor architectures.
    Also need to add support for reading the program symbols from a suitable
    file in /proc for other operating systems that support it.  If there is no
    support for either of these methods then the PROGFILE option can currently
    be used to specify the program name at run-time.

  * The -d option to the mpatrol shell script does not always work on systems
    whose dynamic linkers support the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.  This
    needs to be looked into in order to find out the cause.


Notes for Amiga platforms

  * The supplied SAS/C Makefile contains support for building the mpatrol
    library as a shared library, but this is incomplete and will result in link
    errors.  The reason for this is that an Amiga shared library is a separate
    task and would need to build itself a process structure before being able
    to make any calls to the DOS library.  Perhaps it's not even worth
    implementing as the archive library works fine.

  * Need to add support for call stack traversal for both the Motorola 680x0 and
    PowerPC processor architectures.  At first glance, this doesn't seem to be
    very easy, or perhaps even impossible.

  * Need to add support for reading symbols from Amiga executable files.  Also
    need to add support for reading symbols from any shared libraries that are
    required by the program.  The Amiga executable file format doesn't seem to
    contain enough information for this to be worthwhile, and even then it would
    only be worth doing if call stack traversal worked.

  * It is currently not possible to override the definition of malloc(), etc.,
    without including the mpatrol.h header file first.  This is because the
    compiler startup code and libraries call malloc() before everything is set
    up, and so the library cannot properly initialise itself if the malloc()
    that the startup code finds is the malloc() in the mpatrol library.


Notes for Windows platforms

  * Need to add watch point area support, possibly by using guard pages as a
    basis for an implementation.

  * Need to add support for reading symbols from Windows executable files.  Also
    need to add support for reading symbols from any DLLs that are required by
    the program.  This may be possible in a limited fashion by using the GNU BFD
    library, but may only work with code compiled with GCC.

  * It is currently not possible to override the definitions of malloc(), etc.,
    without including the mpatrol.h header file first.  This is because the
    system startup code calls malloc() before anything is set up, such as
    streams, and so the library cannot properly initialise itself if the
    malloc() that the startup code finds is the malloc() in the mpatrol library.


Notes for Netware platforms

  * The library has not yet been built (let alone tested) on Netware platforms.
    The names of the system functions that the library calls for Netware were
    obtained by looking at Novell's developer documentation, so they may not
    even compile correctly without modification.

  * Need to add support for building the mpatrol library as an NLM.  This is not
    currently a high priority requirement as the archive library should suffice
    for most purposes.

  * Need to add way to determine when the base of the stack has been reached
    during call stack traversal, since on Netware every application is really a
    thread running under one large process.

  * Need to add support for reading symbols from Netware load modules.  Also
    need to add support for reading symbols from any NLMs that are required by
    the program.  This may be possible in a limited fashion by using the GNU BFD
    library, but may only work with code compiled with GCC.

  * Need to investigate if it is safe (or even possible) to override the
    definitions of malloc(), etc., without including the mpatrol.h header file
    first.  Currently, non-macro definitions for these functions have been
    disabled in the Netware version of the library in case they affect other
    NLMs that are currently running.


Adding support for a new operating system

  * Add a new TARGET and/or SYSTEM definition in target.h.  The TARGET macro is
    for fundamentally different operating systems, whereas the SYSTEM macro is
    for differentiating variations of a particular operating system.

  * Make any necessary modifications to config.h.

  * Add any support for memory allocation in memory.c.

  * Add any support for stack traversal in stack.c.

  * Add any support for signals in signals.c.

  * Add any support for threads in mutex.c.

  * Add a new version and date format (or use an existing one) in version.c.

  * Decide if the malloc() replacements should be used from mpatrol.c.

  * Add a new subdirectory in the build directory that contains a Makefile
    and any other files that are required to build the library on the new
    operating system.


Adding support for a new processor architecture

  * Add a new ARCH definition in target.h.

  * Make any necessary modifications to config.h.

  * Add any support for memory allocation in memory.c.

  * Add any support for stack traversal in stack.c.


Adding support for a new object file format

  * Add a new FORMAT definition in target.h.

  * Make any necessary modifications to config.h.

  * Add any support for stack traversal in stack.c.

  * Add any support for symbol reading in symbol.c.
