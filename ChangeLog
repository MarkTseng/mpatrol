	* EXAMPLES:
	Added information about the total warnings and errors displayed at

	* src/diag.c:
	Added information about the total number of warnings and errors.

	* src/utils.h:
	Added macro versions of some routines for efficiency reasons.

	* src/utils.c:
	Conditionally compile some routines depending on the macro
	MP_MACROROUTINES.

	* src/config.h:
	Added the MP_MACROROUTINES macro which indicates if macro versions of
	certain routines are to be used for efficiency reasons.

	* src/memory.c:
	Improved __mp_memcheck() to be much more efficient for large blocks of
	memory.

	* NOTES: Added library performance figures and more related software.

	* README: Changed Solaris 2.7 to Solaris 7.

	* EXAMPLES: Added note about not using the library in release builds.

	* README: Documented the USEMMAP option.

Thu Oct 14 23:59:42 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/option.c:
	Added the USEMMAP option for UNIX platforms that support mmap().

	* src/memory.c:
	Added support for allocating memory using mmap() on UNIX platforms that
	support it.

	* src/memory.h:
	Changed the name of the watch point control file handle field and added
	a memory mapped file handle field.

	* src/config.h: Added MP_MMAP_SUPPORT and MP_MMAP_FILENAME.

Wed Oct 13 21:22:30 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* EXAMPLES: New file for illustrating how to use the library.

Tue Oct 12 19:18:30 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/alloc.c:
	Fixed the problem in splitnode() whereby the free node would be lost if
	there was no more system memory to allocate the leftmost or rightmost
	nodes.

	* src/symbol.c:
	Don't attempt to read from _DYNAMIC if its address is NULL, since that
	will be the case if the program is statically linked.

Sun Oct 10 10:21:00 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* bin/mupdate:
	Only update ChangeLog if it has changed since the last release.

Tue Oct  5 17:35:19 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/info.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_checkinfo() when all allocations are pages and no
	freed allocations are being reused, since we don't need to check
	overflow buffers if the allocation has been freed.

	* src/stack.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_newframe() if using MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT when the
	loop went round one too many times, causing an infinite loop.

Sun Oct  3 22:50:22 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/inter.c:
	Fixed problem in __mp_info() where the check for a known memory block
	was doing an || instead of an && in the test.
