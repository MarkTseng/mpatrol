	* src/alloc.c:
	Fixed the problem in splitnode() whereby the free node would be lost if
	there was no more system memory to allocate the leftmost or rightmost
	nodes.

	* src/symbol.c:
	Don't attempt to read from _DYNAMIC if its address is NULL, since that
	will be the case if the program is statically linked.

	* src/info.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_checkinfo() when all allocations are pages and no
	freed allocations are being reused, since we don't need to check
	overflow buffers if the allocation has been freed.

	* src/stack.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_newframe() if using MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT when the
	loop went round one too many times, causing an infinite loop.

	* src/inter.c:
	Fixed problem in __mp_info() where the check for a known memory block
	was doing an || instead of an && in the test.
