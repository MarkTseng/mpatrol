	* src/memory.c:
	Added support for allocating memory using mmap() on UNIX platforms that
	support it.

	* src/memory.h:

Wed Oct 13 21:22:30 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

Tue Oct 12 19:18:30 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/alloc.c:
	Fixed the problem in splitnode() whereby the free node would be lost if
	there was no more system memory to allocate the leftmost or rightmost
	nodes.

	* src/symbol.c:
	Don't attempt to read from _DYNAMIC if its address is NULL, since that
	will be the case if the program is statically linked.

Sun Oct 10 10:21:00 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* bin/mupdate:
	Only update ChangeLog if it has changed since the last release.

Tue Oct  5 17:35:19 1999  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/info.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_checkinfo() when all allocations are pages and no
	freed allocations are being reused, since we don't need to check
	overflow buffers if the allocation has been freed.

	* src/stack.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_newframe() if using MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT when the
	loop went round one too many times, causing an infinite loop.
